    "# Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "It has been quite confusing to define what a popular game is by the total counts of user reviews, therefore, the goal of our project is to create a relatively objective universal model to evaluate whether a new game would be popular. The data of the dataset represents multiple criterias of the games, and some of the data are categorical (boolean), including the supported systems and rating(positive/negative), and the rest of the data are statistical, which includes the total counts of user reviews, the positive ratios of the games, the initial and final prices of the games, and the discounts that were offered. We will be using the algorithms that were learned in class, and we will divide these data into a training set (validation set), and test set to create and train our model to fit as closely as possible to the dataset, and we will use this model to predict a new game, and determine if it is popular or not. Finally, the performance will be measured using the f1 score.\n"

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Personal Computer (PC) video games, as one of the primary forms of entertainment of the public, have long been drawing people’s attention due to their highly engaging and versatile nature. According to the latest gaming statistics, the global video game industry has accumulated a tremendous consumer base (ie. approximately 38% of the worldwide population has video gaming experiences), forming a total market size, measured by yielded revenues, of approximately $106.8 billions in 2023.[^1] \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the global video game industry has still been undergoing a developmental stage of rapid growth due to high market demand. The market size of the global video game industry, as the statistics indicated, is estimated to increase 9.4% over the year of 2023 and reach approximately 135 billion dollars by 2025, in which the PC gaming sector alone will accumulate around $46.7 billion. Through this tremendous consumer base and the capability of creating immersive, captivating worlds that enable individuals to explore various cultures and experiences, the video game industry undeniably has crucial impacts on people’s entertainment and social & cultural trends in the modern era. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the video game market back in early 2000s where the majority sales occurred at retail stores, the digital distribution platforms, such as Steam, GamersGate, Microsoft Store, EA Origin, and so forth, have been contributing to the majority (approximately 83%) of the global video game sales nowadays. Steam, as the top digital distribution platform in terms of video game sales and number of users, for instance, accounts for approximately 50% to 70% of the entire PC video game downloads as well as 75% of the global vertical market. Such digital distribution platforms employ a series of marketing and sale strategies/practices that satisfy their active users’ demand as well as maximize their revenues and market shares. Among such business practices, building and employing a reliable, efficient model, which is capable of yielding sound estimations of popularity of video games, play the essential role in optimizing business operations. Therefore, in order to not only acquire a complete knowledge of the future development of the video game industry but also generate accurate recommendations of the products (ie. games), which ensures promising sales, it is absolutely necessary to establish an effective evaluation mechanism as mentioned above. Quite a few prior studies/works have gone on in the research area of PC video game recommendation systems. The “Predicting the Popularity of Games on Steam,” for instance, investigates & analyzes data of game genres, features, prices, developers, etc., from Steam and develops a predictive model that aims to discover the popularity of PC video games through the evaluation of their post-release success. Our project employs a similar approach (ie. establishing an evaluation mechanism that accurately and objectively predicts the popularity of PC video games), yet examines the data that focuses on the feedbacks & reviews and sales information of the games of different genres released on Steam, including total counts of user reviews, the positive ratios of the games, the initial and final prices of the games, and the discounts that were offered. Through this project, we aim to facilitate the customer targeting process of the digital PC video game distribution platforms, aiding them with objective more time-saving, accurate user-specific video game \n"

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like what we have mentioned above, the input of our data includes two major categories — categorical variables and statistical variables, hence our solution/model needs to include several algorithms in order to take both of these variables into account when deciding whether the game is recommended or not. We will be using one-hot encoding for the categorical variables(boolean), which means we will transform the data such as the supported system of the game. Then we will add the sum of the variables for each row, since each row represents a game. This will determine the games that are most adaptive, since the higher the sum is, the most systems it could be implemented on. Then, we will be using linear regression to tackle the statistical variable, which means we will use the linear regression to test the correlation between the rating scales(positive/negative) and the ratio. Next, we will create a model that combines these two algorithms, and the model would be a binary classification model, which means it could be used to determine whether a game is popular or not. More user reviews indicate more people are actually playing this game, which means the game is more likely to be above the decision boundary(we will also include other measuring standards like positive rating, price, sales, gaming hours). After creating the model, we will use a game that was not in the dataset and take the specs of the games back into our model to test the accuracy(we are trying to check the generalization here, therefore we will utilize newly released games that are not in the original dataset . Moreover, the metric that we will be using is F1 score, which is a metric that is used to determine the performance of a binary classification model.\n",

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation metric that we chose is the F1 score, as we learned in the class, the F1 score is used to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model, which fits our model(the intended solution) perfectly, since we are trying to generate a model that could classify either a game is popular or not, and unlike other metrics, F1 scores takes both precision and recall into account, which means it is the most balanced metric among them. This is important in our case, since the false positives and false negatives are equally important. False positives in this case represents the game that is actually not popular but is classified as a popular game, which would increase the potential buyers of the game, and also increase the potential financial loss to the buyers since the game might not be worth buying; and the false negatives indicate that the game is actually a popular game but the model classified it as an unpopular game, which would potentially cause financial loss to the companies since the number of potential buyers would decrease. Therefore, the F1 score would be the best option since it could tell us how the model is performing based on these two factors(FN and FP). The mathematical representations of this metric is F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall), and the metric is derived from the harmonic mean of precision and recall.\n",
